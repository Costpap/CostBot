# CostBot

This repository is home to all the code used by CostBot, a Discord Bot coded in [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js).

## Running the bot
Once you've installed all the [dependencies](../network/dependencies), rename `config.json.example` to `config.json` and replace all of the fields with their respective values. Then, you can run `npm run start` and your bot should now to be logged in.
